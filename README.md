# I-PIA

A simple library for fitting an implicit surface by
[progressive-iterative approximation](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cagd.2020.101817).

Basic geometry is provided by my [libgeom](http://github.com/salvipeter/libgeom/) library.

The test program also uses my [dual contouring](http://github.com/salvipeter/dual-contouring/)
library and the [TCLAP](http://tclap.sourceforge.net/) command line parser.
